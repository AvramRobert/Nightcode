## Introduction

Nightcode is a simple IDE for Clojure and Java. It integrates a copy of Leiningen as well as the lein-droid and lein-cljsbuild plugins. The goal is to provide a simple, all-in-one solution to get started with Clojure/Java programming for the console, the desktop, the web, and Android.

## Licensing

All source files that originate from this project are dedicated to the public domain. That particularly includes the files in `src/clojure/nightcode`. All third-party code in this project remains under their original licenses. I would love pull requests, and will assume that any Clojure contributions are also dedicated to the public domain.
